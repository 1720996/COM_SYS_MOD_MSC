<h1>Aims</h1>	
The course aims to provide a self-contained introduction to the mathematical theory and analysis of complex networks and graphs.

<h1>Learning Outcomes</h1>
Students will be able to describe and analyse properties of complex systems with network theory.
  
<h1>Contents</h1>
The course starts with an overview of application domains of complex networks, followed by definitions and topological characteristics of networks and their adjacency matrices. It then proceeds with the analysis of random graphs with imposed topological features (starting from the Erdos-Renyi model), spectral properties of graphs and their adjacency and Laplacian matrices, generating function methods, and (as time permits) more advanced topics.
